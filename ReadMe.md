- **üì∏ Instant Food Recognition**: Point camera at food for instant nutrition data
- **üìä Comprehensive Database**: 700+ foods with glycemic index data
- **üîí Privacy First**: All processing happens on your device
- **üì± Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection
- **üíö Health Connect Integration**: Syncs with Android Health platform

## üì¶ Downloads

- **[Latest Release (v1.4.0)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-xZpzdZA3NEv48slvQVASs6c6MYEBCF/view?usp=drive_link)** - Standard APK (requires internet for models)
- **[Offline Package](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jvMmeec--PYCZfIY3sXKF5LM9YHlM5w-?usp=drive_link)** - Pre-bundled with AI models
- **[All Releases](RELEASES.md)** - Version history and changelogs

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Android device (API 24+) with 6GB+ RAM
- 5GB free storage for AI models
- WiFi/Internet connection for initial model download
- Android Studio (for building from source)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download Pre-built APK (Recommended)

1. **Download GemYum v1.4.0**
   - [Download APK from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-xZpzdZA3NEv48slvQVASs6c6MYEBCF/view?usp=drive_link)
   - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings
   - Install the APK on your device

2. **Download AI Models (Required)**
   - Launch the app after installation
   - Connect to WiFi/Internet for model download
   - The app will download Gemma 3n models (~3-4GB):
     - [E2B Model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-3n/tfLite/gemma-3n-E2B-it-int4) - 2GB (Required)
     - [E4B Model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-3n/tfLite/gemma-3n-E4B-it-int4) - 4GB (Optional, better accuracy)
   - Models are downloaded once and work offline thereafter

#### Option 2: Offline Installation (No Internet Required)
For devices without internet access, use the pre-bundled APK with models:
- [Offline Installation Package](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jvMmeec--PYCZfIY3sXKF5LM9YHlM5w-?usp=drive_link)
