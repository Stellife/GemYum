# Claude Development Notes - GemMunch Session 5

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Goal**: Enhance ChatViewModel with function calling behavior for rapid nutrition analysis

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced Chat Implementation
Created `EnhancedChatViewModel` that simulates function calling behavior using structured prompts:
- **Agent-like behavior**: AI analyzes meals and automatically looks up nutrition data
- **JSON-structured responses**: Forces AI to respond with parseable data
- **Progress tracking**: Shows each food item as it's being looked up
- **Smart clarification**: AI asks specific questions when needed

### 2. Two Chat Modes Implemented

#### Analyze & Chat Mode (with Camera)
- Takes photo input via `currentImageBitmap`
- Uses MediaPipe vision session with `BitmapImageBuilder`
- Analyzes image to identify foods
- Example flow: Photo → "I see 3 tacos" → "From which restaurant?" → Nutrition lookup

#### Text-Only Mode
- Pure text description input
- Faster processing without image overhead
- Example: "I had a burger and fries" → Immediate nutrition lookups

### 3. Key Technical Features

#### Structured Prompt Engineering
```kotlin
Output ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
    "foods": [
        {"name": "food item", "quantity": 1.0, "unit": "serving"}
    ],
    "needsClarification": false,
    "question": null
}
```

#### Agent Loop Pattern
1. AI analyzes input (text or image)
2. Extracts food items as JSON
3. Looks up each item in nutrition database
4. Shows progress for each lookup
5. Compiles total nutrition summary
6. Offers Health Connect save

#### Image Integration
```kotlin
// Add image to vision session
val mpImage = BitmapImageBuilder(bitmap).build()
session.addImage(mpImage)
```

### 4. Health Connect Integration
- Dialog appears after nutrition analysis
- Shows total calories before saving
- One-tap save to Health Connect
- Graceful error handling if permissions missing

### 5. UI Enhancements
- Created `EnhancedChatScreen` with clean Material 3 design
- Loading indicators during AI processing
- Progress messages for each food lookup
- Nutrition summary with formatted totals
- Welcome messages tailored to each mode

## Implementation Strategy

### Why Not True Function Calling?
Due to time constraints and SDK complexity, implemented a pragmatic solution:
1. **Structured prompts** achieve similar results to function calling
2. **JSON parsing** provides reliable data extraction
3. **Manual nutrition lookups** simulate function execution
4. **User experience** is identical to true function calling

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-warmed vision sessions from AppContainer
- Single session reuse for conversation
- Minimal conversation context (current meal only)
- Direct database queries without intermediate processing

## Code Structure

### Key Files Created/Modified
1. `EnhancedChatViewModel.kt` - Core agent logic
2. `EnhancedChatScreen.kt` - UI implementation
3. `AppContainer.kt` - Exposed `visionLlmInference` for FC SDK compatibility
4. `MainActivity.kt` - Updated to use enhanced ViewModels

### Removed Files
- `ChatViewModel.kt` - Replaced by enhanced version
- `ChatViewModelFC.kt` - FC SDK attempt (too complex for timeline)
- `ChatScreen.kt` - Replaced by enhanced version

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Text
- Input: "I had a banana"
- Output: "Looking up: banana (1.0 serving)... ✓ banana - 105 cal"

### Scenario 2: Multiple Items
- Input: "Grilled chicken salad with ranch"
- Output: Multiple lookups shown progressively

### Scenario 3: Image Analysis
- Input: Photo of meal
- Output: AI identifies items, may ask clarification

### Scenario 4: Unknown Foods
- Input: "Buddha bowl"
- Output: AI asks for ingredients if not in database

## Competition Highlights

For the submission, emphasize:

1. **"Agent-like behavior"** - AI autonomously performs nutrition lookups
2. **"Structured data extraction"** - Reliable JSON parsing for accuracy  
3. **"Progressive feedback"** - User sees each step of the process
4. **"Minimal interactions"** - Usually completes in 1-2 exchanges
5. **"On-device intelligence"** - All processing happens locally

## Next Steps

If time permits:
1. Test all navigation flows thoroughly
2. Add more robust error handling
3. Optimize for edge cases
4. Record demo video highlighting agent behavior

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pragmatic solutions win** - Structured prompts achieved FC-like behavior
2. **User experience matters** - Progress tracking makes AI feel intelligent
3. **JSON is powerful** - Forcing structured output improves reliability
4. **Keep it simple** - Complex SDK integrations risky under time pressure
